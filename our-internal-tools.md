## Our Internal Tools

We use different tools to operate our company. They are the following ones:


### JIRA

It's the Project Management tool we use to define the design & development iterations.

### Trello

It's the Project Management tool we use for small projects like landing pages since there won't be a lot of iterations and people involved into the process.

### InVision

It's the prototyping tool we use to validate our assumptions with the potential users with clickable solutions that allow us to test our concepts on design stage.

### Zeplin

It's the tool we use to transfer all the assets and design details to our developers so they can implement the web or mobile design into the code.
