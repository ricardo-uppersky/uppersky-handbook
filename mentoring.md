## Mentoring

We encourage our team members to be part of mentoring programs of different acceleration programs and incubators. This way we can share our knowledge and give back to the Startup Community in different cities and also expand our network of potential partners, team members and customers. Some of the mentoring programs we're currently involved are:

- [Startup Chile](http://www.startupchile.org)
- [MassChallenge](https://masschallenge.org)
- [Kickstart Accelerator](https://kickstart-accelerator.com)
- [Founder Institute Prague & Oslo](https://fi.co)
- [START Incubator](https://startincubator.org)


We are open to collaborate on other mentoring programs.
