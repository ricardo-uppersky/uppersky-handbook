## Uppersky

We are group of young professionals helping start-ups and entrepreneurs with branding, digital campaigns, web  &  mobile app design and development. Whether you are in the early stages of defining your product/market fit or looking to grow your existing customer base, we are here to support you. We know that starting a new business or running a start-up is hard and can be extremely stressful. So why not to share the load with us?

We are a worldwide remote agency and we work independently from clientsâ€™ locations. Our main partners are currently in the USA, Norway, the Czech Republic, Panama and Chile but we are happy to help no matter where you're currently located. The advantage of our international team of developers, designers, and digital specialists is that we have insights into different markets and can operate in different languages. Therefore, we can create a tailored solution for your business that fits your target audience, wherever that may be.
