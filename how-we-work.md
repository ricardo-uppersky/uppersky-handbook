## How We Work

Once we make an initial meeting with our customer, we define the best approach that could bring the best result to the customer depending on different variables like time, funding and status of the product-market fit. Below you can find the different methodologies.


### Building Minimum Lovable Products

When a customer approach to us, we'll receive all the possible requirements and evaluate the feasibility to make them happen in a period of 3 months.

To satisfy this time period, we'll consult with:

- The potential users. To understand the needs they require to be solved.
- The customer. To understand his business goals.
- Other stakeholders. To understand their expectations.

Once this consultation is done, we'll narrow down to the most important requirements to satisfy most of the stakeholders in the following order: potential users, customer and other stakeholders.

After all the core features are defined, we'll make the following steps:

- Branding Stylesheet (if needed)
- Wireframing
- Visual Design
- Development
- Release. Ideally we'll make periodical releases during the development iterations.


### Making Cycles

Another methodology that we suggest to our customers and inspired by Basecamp, it's a 6 weeks cycle where a team compounded by a designer, frontend developer and backend developer will help you to make an initial product in a 6 weeks cycle. This time is enough to have some significant progress, although the goal of this methodology is to be flexible on the requirements/expectations and allow the team to define the most feasible and easiest way to solve a problem.


### Collaborating per hours

Once a project doesn't have a clear scope, we require to make maintenance of an existing product or you want to extend your current team on-demand, we suggest to work on your project per hours. Our team report their execution time in weekly basis and we can establish the average spent time and fix the issues or create new features for your digital product.
